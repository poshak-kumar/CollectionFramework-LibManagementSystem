The **Java Collection Framework** is a unified architecture that defines a standard way to store and manipulate collections of objects. The hierarchy consists of several interfaces and classes organized into a tree structure, with interfaces at the top and classes that implement those interfaces at the bottom. Below is the complete hierarchy of the Collection Framework.

---

### **1. Collection Framework Hierarchy Overview**

The framework is broadly divided into two types of collections:
- **Collection Interface**: This interface defines a group of objects (elements). It is extended by **List**, **Set**, and **Queue**.
- **Map Interface**: This interface defines a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

### **3. Detailed Hierarchy**

#### **A. Collection (Interface)**

The `Collection` interface is the root interface for handling groups of objects. The hierarchy below extends from `Collection`.

1. **List Interface**:
   - A **List** is an ordered collection that allows duplicates. Elements can be accessed by their index.
   - Implementations:
     - **ArrayList**: Resizable array implementation, fast random access but slow inserts/removals.
     - **LinkedList**: Doubly linked list, efficient for inserts/removals but slower for random access.
     - **Vector**: Synchronized version of `ArrayList`.
       - **Stack**: A subclass of `Vector` representing a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack.
     - **CopyOnWriteArrayList**: A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` where every modification creates a new copy of the underlying array.

   ```java
   List<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
   List<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
   ```

2. **Set Interface**:
   - A **Set** is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements and may be unordered.
   - Implementations:
     - **HashSet**: Implements a set backed by a hash table, provides constant-time performance for basic operations.
     - **LinkedHashSet**: Maintains insertion order in addition to being backed by a hash table.
     - **TreeSet**: Implements a set that is sorted according to natural order or a custom comparator.
     - **EnumSet**: A specialized `Set` for use with enum types.

   ```java
   Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
   Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
   ```

3. **Queue Interface**:
   - A **Queue** is a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Typically follows **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) order.
   - Implementations:
     - **PriorityQueue**: Implements a priority queue where elements are ordered by their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
     - **ArrayDeque**: Implements a **deque** (double-ended queue) that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
     - **LinkedList**: Implements both `List` and `Deque` interfaces, can be used as a queue or a list.

   ```java
   Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   Queue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
   ```

4. **Deque Interface** (Double-Ended Queue):
   - A **Deque** is a linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
   - Implementations:
     - **ArrayDeque**: Implements a resizable array that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.

   ```java
   Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
   ```

#### **B. Map Interface**

The `Map` interface represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

1. **HashMap**:
   - Implements the basic `Map` interface with no guarantees about the order of elements. Allows null keys and values.
   
2. **LinkedHashMap**:
   - Extends `HashMap`, maintains a doubly-linked list of entries in the order in which they were inserted.
   
3. **TreeMap**:
   - Implements a `Map` where the elements are sorted according to their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
   
4. **WeakHashMap**:
   - Implements a map with weak references to its keys, allowing garbage collection of keys when they are no longer referenced.

5. **EnumMap**:
   - Specialized implementation for enum keys, which is highly efficient.

6. **SortedMap Interface**:
   - A `SortedMap` is a map that maintains its elements in a sorted order.
   - Implementations:
     - **NavigableMap**: Extends `SortedMap` to provide navigation methods like `lowerEntry()`, `higherEntry()`, `ceilingEntry()`, etc.
     - **TreeMap**: Implements both `NavigableMap` and `SortedMap`.

   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
   Map<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
   ```

#### **C. Collections Utility Class**

In addition to the core interfaces and implementations, Java provides the `Collections` utility class, which contains static methods for common operations such as sorting, searching, and synchronization of collections.

- **Important Methods**:
  - `sort(List<T> list)`: Sorts a list in natural or custom order.
  - `reverse(List<?> list)`: Reverses the order of elements in a list.
  - `shuffle(List<?> list)`: Randomly shuffles the elements in a list.
  - `binarySearch(List<? extends T> list, T key)`: Searches a sorted list using binary search.
  - `synchronizedList(List<T> list)`: Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) version of the list.

### **Conclusion**

The Java Collection Framework is a powerful set of tools for working with data structures in Java. It provides a clear and flexible architecture that includes a variety of interfaces, each tailored to specific data needs, as well as their respective implementations. The `Collection` and `Map` interfaces serve as the backbone, while classes like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, and `TreeMap` provide practical implementations of these interfaces.

### **What are the Legacy Classes**

In Java, **Legacy Classes** are classes that were part of the earlier versions of Java (prior to Java 2, i.e., Java 1.2), before the introduction of the **Java Collection Framework** (JCF). When the Collection Framework was introduced in Java 2, these legacy classes were restructured and integrated into it, but they still exist in their original form for backward compatibility. They have certain design patterns that are less flexible compared to the modern collection framework.

Legacy classes are generally considered **obsolete** and **less efficient** than the newer collection classes (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`). However, they are still available in the Java API to support older codebases.

---

### **Key Legacy Classes in Java**

The main legacy classes in Java include:
1. **Hashtable**
2. **Vector**
3. **Stack**
4. **Properties**
5. **Enumeration Interface** (This is not a class, but a legacy interface).

These classes were part of the `java.util` package prior to the introduction of the Collection Framework.

---

### **1. Hashtable**

- **Description**: `Hashtable` is a legacy class that implements a map using a **hash table**. It stores **key-value pairs**, and all keys are unique. In many ways, it is similar to the modern `HashMap` class, but `Hashtable` is **synchronized** by default, which means that it is thread-safe but also less efficient.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **Synchronized**: All methods in `Hashtable` are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe, but this also introduces performance overhead.
  - **No null keys or values**: Unlike `HashMap`, `Hashtable` does not allow null keys or values.
  - **Part of Legacy API**: `Hashtable` was retrofitted to implement the `Map` interface when the Collection Framework was introduced.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Hashtable<Integer, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();
  hashtable.put(1, "Java");
  hashtable.put(2, "Python");
  hashtable.put(3, "C++");
  ```

- **Modern Replacement**: `HashMap` is a more modern and preferred alternative to `Hashtable` for non-thread-safe implementations, and `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe usage.

---

### **2. Vector**

- **Description**: `Vector` is a legacy class that implements a **dynamic array**. It is very similar to the `ArrayList` class introduced in the Collection Framework, but `Vector` is **synchronized** by default.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **Synchronized**: All methods in `Vector` are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe. However, this makes `Vector` less efficient in single-threaded environments.
  - **Growth Factor**: If the number of elements exceeds the current capacity of the `Vector`, it automatically resizes by doubling its size (by default).
  - **Implements List Interface**: With the introduction of the Collection Framework, `Vector` was modified to implement the `List` interface.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
  vector.add("Java");
  vector.add("Python");
  vector.add("C++");
  ```

- **Modern Replacement**: `ArrayList` is preferred over `Vector` because it is not synchronized by default, making it faster in most use cases. For thread-safe operations, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a modern alternative.

---

### **3. Stack**

- **Description**: `Stack` is a subclass of `Vector` that implements a **last-in, first-out (LIFO)** stack of objects. It is a legacy class designed specifically for stack operations, but it inherits the synchronization characteristics of `Vector`, making it slower compared to newer stack implementations.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **LIFO Structure**: `Stack` follows the LIFO principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
  - **Synchronized**: Since `Stack` extends `Vector`, it inherits its thread-safe but performance-limiting characteristics.
  - **Methods**: The `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and `empty()` methods are provided for typical stack operations.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
  stack.push("Java");
  stack.push("Python");
  stack.push("C++");
  System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Outputs "C++"
  ```

- **Modern Replacement**: The `Deque` interface (with classes like `ArrayDeque`) provides a more efficient and flexible way to implement stacks. `ArrayDeque` is faster and non-synchronized.

---

### **4. Properties**

- **Description**: `Properties` is a subclass of `Hashtable` used to maintain a list of **key-value pairs** where both keys and values are strings. It is commonly used to store configuration settings, such as application properties, in Java.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **String-Based Keys and Values**: The keys and values must be of type `String`.
  - **Used for Configuration**: `Properties` objects are frequently used to store application settings in properties files (with `.properties` extension).
  - **Persistent Storage**: The `load()` and `store()` methods allow the loading and saving of properties from and to files.
  
- **Example**:
  ```java
  Properties properties = new Properties();
  properties.setProperty("username", "admin");
  properties.setProperty("password", "12345");

  // Saving properties to a file
  properties.store(new FileOutputStream("config.properties"), null);
  ```

- **No Modern Replacement**: `Properties` is still widely used for configuration purposes in Java applications.

---

### **5. Enumeration Interface**

- **Description**: `Enumeration` is a legacy interface for traversing or iterating over collections, like `Vector` or `Hashtable`. It was the precursor to the **Iterator** interface introduced with the Collection Framework.

- **Key Points**:
  - **Limited Features**: `Enumeration` is less powerful than `Iterator`. For example, it does not support element removal during iteration.
  - **Methods**:
    - `boolean hasMoreElements()`: Checks if more elements are available for iteration.
    - `Object nextElement()`: Retrieves the next element in the iteration.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
  vector.add("Java");
  vector.add("Python");

  Enumeration<String> enumeration = vector.elements();
  while (enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
      System.out.println(enumeration.nextElement());
  }
  ```

- **Modern Replacement**: The `Iterator` and `ListIterator` interfaces are preferred over `Enumeration` because they are more flexible and offer additional functionality, such as element removal during iteration.

---

### **Modern Alternatives and Why Legacy Classes Are Discouraged**

While the legacy classes are still available, they are generally discouraged for the following reasons:
1. **Synchronized by Default**: Legacy classes like `Vector` and `Hashtable` are synchronized, which can lead to performance bottlenecks in non-concurrent applications.
2. **Less Flexible Design**: The modern collection classes (such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.) are designed with more flexibility and efficiency in mind.
3. **Modern Collection Framework**: The Java Collection Framework provides more powerful, flexible, and efficient tools. For example, the `Iterator` interface provides enhanced traversal options compared to `Enumeration`.

### **Legacy Classes vs Modern Classes**

| **Legacy Class** | **Modern Alternative**     | **Key Differences**                               |
|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Hashtable`      | `HashMap`, `ConcurrentHashMap` | `Hashtable` is synchronized, while `HashMap` is not. |
| `Vector`         | `ArrayList`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` | `Vector` is synchronized, `ArrayList` is faster for single-threaded use. |
| `Stack`          | `Deque`, `ArrayDeque`        | `Deque` provides more flexible and faster stack operations. |
| `Enumeration`    | `Iterator`                 | `Iterator` offers additional functionality such as element removal. |

---

### **Conclusion**

In Java, legacy classes like `Vector`, `Stack`, `Hashtable`, and `Properties` were part of the pre-collection framework, and while they are still supported, they are rarely used in modern Java development. The **Java Collection Framework** introduced more efficient, flexible, and thread-safe alternatives, such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Deque`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`, which should be preferred in modern applications.

Using legacy classes in new code is generally discouraged unless backward compatibility is necessary.
